                            Brazil, officially the <i>Federative Republic of Brazil</i>,is
                            the largest country in South America and in Latin America.
                            Brazil is the world's <mark> fifth-largest country </mark> by
                            area and the <u>seventh most populous</u>. Its capital is
                            Brasília, and its most populous city is São Paulo. The
                            federation is composed of the union of the 26 states and the
                            Federal District. It is the only country in the Americas to have
                            Portuguese as an official language. It is one of the most
                            multicultural and ethnically diverse nations, due to over a
                            century of mass immigration from around the world, and the most
                            populous Roman Catholic-majority country. Bounded by the
                            Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of 7,491
                            kilometers (4,655 mi). It borders all other countries and
                            territories in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers
                            roughly half of the continent's land area. Its Amazon basin
                            includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a
                            variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources
                            spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental
                            heritage positions Brazil at number one of 17 megadiverse
                            countries, and is the subject of significant global interest, as
                            environmental degradation through processes like deforestation
                            has direct impacts on global issues like climate change and
                            biodiversity loss.

                                            chouriço, morcela (blood sausage), farinheira, and others, which may or may

                                            The brigadeiro is a traditional Brazilian dessert. The origin of the dessert
                                            is uncertain, but the most common theory is that it was created by a
                                            confectioner from Rio de Janeiro, Heloisa Nabuco de Oliveira, to promote the

                                            Tapioca is a starch extracted from the storage roots of the cassava plant, a
                                            species native to the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, but whose use
                                            is now spread throughout South America. It is a perennial shrub adapted to
                                            the hot conditions of tropical lowlands. Cassava copes better with poor
                                            soils than many other food plants.

                                            The species is native to eastern Amazonia, especially in Brazil, mainly in
                                            swamps and floodplains. The fruit is small, round, and black-purple in
                                            color. The fruit became a staple
                                            food in floodplain areas around the 18th century, but its consumption in
                                            urban areas and promotion as a health food only began in the mid 1990s along
                                            with the popularization of other Amazonian fruits outside the region. </div>
